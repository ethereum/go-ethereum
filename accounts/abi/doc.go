// Package abi implements the Ethereum ABI (Application Binary
// Interface).
//
// The Ethereum ABI is strongly typed, known at compile time
// and static. This ABI will handle basic type casting; unsigned
// to signed and visa versa. It does not handle slice casting such
// as unsigned slice to signed slice. Bit size type casting is also
// handled. ints with a bit size of 32 will be properly cast to int256,
// etc.
