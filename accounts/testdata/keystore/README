The other files (including this README) are broken in various ways
and should not be picked up by package accounts:

- File: no-address (missing address field, otherwise same as "aaa")
- File: garbage (file with random data)
- File: empty (file with no content)
- File: swapfile~ (should be skipped)
- File: .hiddenfile (should be skipped)
- File: foo/... (should be skipped because it is a directory)
