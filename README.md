# MEV-geth

This is a fork of go-ethereum, [the original README is here](README.original.md).

Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains. We propose a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction that reinforce the Ethereum ideals.

## Quick start

```
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/mev-geth
cd mev-geth
make geth
```

See [here](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/install-and-build/installing-geth#build-go-ethereum-from-source-code) for further info on building MEV-geth from source.
