This PR fixes a few small typos and improves clarity in the
consensus-related documentation.

### Changes
- Fixed minor spelling mistakes ("recieve" → "receive", "enviroment" → "environment")
- Improved punctuation in several sentences
- Rephrased unclear sentences for readability
- Removed extra trailing spaces

### Why
These are small but relevant improvements that make the documentation more readable
for new contributors and developers. No code logic was changed.

Thanks!
