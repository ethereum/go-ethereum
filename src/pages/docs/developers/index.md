Welcome to the Geth Developer docs!

This section includes information for builders. If you are building decentralized apps on top of Geth, head to the `dapp-developer` docs. If you are developing Geth itself, explore the `geth-developer` docs.

## Dapp developers

Geth has many features that support dapp developers. There are many built-in tracers implemented in Go or Javascript that allow developers to monitor what is happening in Geth from inside an app, and users can build their own custom tracers too. Geth also includes a suite of tools for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts using Geth functions using Go functions inside Go native applications. There is also information for Geth mobile developers.

## Geth developers

Geth developers add/remove features and fix bugs in Geth. The `geth-developer` section includes contribution guidelines and documentation relating to testing and disclosing vulnerabilities that willhep you get started with working on Geth.
