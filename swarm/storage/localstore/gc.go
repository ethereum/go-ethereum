Counting number of items in garbage collection index

The number of items in garbage collection index is not the same as the number of
chunks in retrieval index (total number of stored chunks). Chunk can be garbage
collected only when it is set to a synced state by ModSetSync, and only then can
be counted into garbage collection size, which determines whether a number of
chunk should be removed from the storage by the garbage collection. This opens a
possibility that the storage size exceeds the limit if files are locally
uploaded and the node is not connected to other nodes or there is a problem with
syncing.

Tracking of garbage collection size (gcSize) is focused on performance. Key
points:

 1. counting the number of key/value pairs in LevelDB takes around 0.7s for 1e6
    on a very fast ssd (unacceptable long time in reality)
 2. locking leveldb batch writes with a global mutex (serial batch writes) is
    not acceptable, we should use locking per chunk address

Because of point 1. we cannot count the number of items in garbage collection
index in New constructor as it could last very long for realistic scenarios
where limit is 5e6 and nodes are running on slower hdd disks or cloud providers
with low IOPS.

Point 2. is a performance optimization to allow parallel batch writes with
getters, putters and setters. Every single batch that they create contain only
information related to a single chunk, no relations with other chunks or shared
statistical data (like gcSize). This approach avoids race conditions on writing
batches in parallel, but creates a problem of synchronizing statistical data
values like gcSize. With global mutex lock, any data could be written by any
batch, but would not use utilize the full potential of leveldb parallel writes.

To mitigate this two problems, the implementation of counting and persisting
gcSize is split into two parts. One is the in-memory value (gcSize) that is fast
to read and write with a dedicated mutex (gcSizeMu) if the batch which adds or
removes items from garbage collection index is successful. The second part is
the reliable persistence of this value to leveldb database, as storedGCSize
field. This database field is saved by writeGCSizeWorker and writeGCSize
functions when in-memory gcSize variable is changed, but no too often to avoid
very frequent database writes. This database writes are triggered by
writeGCSizeTrigger when a call is made to function incGCSize. Trigger ensures
that no database writes are done only when gcSize is changed (contrary to a
simpler periodic writes or checks). A backoff of 10s in writeGCSizeWorker
ensures that no frequent batch writes are made. Saving the storedGCSize on
database Close function ensures that in-memory gcSize is persisted when database
is closed.

This persistence must be resilient to failures like panics. For this purpose, a
collection of hashes that are added to the garbage collection index, but still
not persisted to storedGCSize, must be tracked to count them in when DB is
constructed again with New function after the failure (swarm node restarts). On
every batch write that adds a new item to garbage collection index, the same
hash is added to gcUncountedHashesIndex. This ensures that there is a persisted
information which hashes were added to the garbage collection index. But, when
the storedGCSize is saved by writeGCSize function, this values are removed in
the same batch in which storedGCSize is changed to ensure consistency. When the
panic happen, or database Close method is not saved. The database storage
contains all information to reliably and efficiently get the correct number of
items in garbage collection index. This is performed in the New function when
all hashes in gcUncountedHashesIndex are counted, added to the storedGCSize and
saved to the disk before the database is constructed again. Index
gcUncountedHashesIndex is acting as dirty bit for recovery that provides
information what needs to be corrected. With a simple dirty bit, the whole
garbage collection index should me counted on recovery instead only the items in
gcUncountedHashesIndex. Because of the triggering mechanizm of writeGCSizeWorker
and relatively short backoff time, the number of hashes in
gcUncountedHashesIndex should be low and it should take a very short time to
recover from the previous failure. If there was no failure and
gcUncountedHashesIndex is empty, which is the usual case, New function will take
the minimal time to return.
