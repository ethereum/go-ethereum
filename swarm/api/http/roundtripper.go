/*
http roundtripper to register for bzz url scheme
see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/2040
Usage:

import (
 "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/common/httpclient"
 "github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/swarm/api/http"
)
client := httpclient.New()
// for (private) swarm proxy running locally
client.RegisterScheme("bzz", &http.RoundTripper{Port: port})
client.RegisterScheme("bzz-immutable", &http.RoundTripper{Port: port})
client.RegisterScheme("bzz-raw", &http.RoundTripper{Port: port})

The port you give the Roundtripper is the port the swarm proxy is listening on.
If Host is left empty, localhost is assumed.

Using a public gateway, the above few lines gives you the leanest
bzz-scheme aware read-only http client. You really only ever need this
if you need go-native swarm access to bzz addresses.
