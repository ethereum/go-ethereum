Swarm is a distributed storage platform and content distribution service, a native base layer service of the Ethereum web3 stack. The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a decentralized and redundant store for dapp code and data as well as blockchain and state data. Swarm also set out to provide various base layer services for web3, including node-to-node messaging, media streaming, decentralized database services and scalable state-channel infrastructure for decentralized service economies.

**Note**: The codebase has been moved to [ethersphere/bee](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee)
