description: introduction to the private-network boot-strapping tool, Puppeth

<Note>Puppeth was [removed from Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/26581) in January 2023.</Note>

Puppeth was a tool for quickly spinning up and managing private development networks. The user was guided through the process by a command line wizard instead of having to configure the network manually. However, this tool has been discontinued and removed from the Geth repository.

Instructions for setting up a private network using Ethash or Clique are available on our [private networks page](/docs/fundamentals/private-network.md).
