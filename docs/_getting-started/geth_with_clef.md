This page explains how to set up Geth and execute some basic tasks using the command line tools. 
In order to use Geth, the software must first be installed. There are several ways Geth can be 
installed depending on the operating system and the user's choice of installation method, for example 
using a package manager, container or building from source. Instructions for installing Geth can be 
found on the ["Install and Build"](install-and-build/installing-geth) pages. The tutorial on this
page assumes Geth and the associated developer tools have been installed successfully.

This page provides step-by-step instructions covering the fundamentals of using Geth. This 
includes generating accounts, joining an Ethereum network, syncing the blockchain and sending ether 
between accounts. This tutorial also uses [Clef](/docs/clef/tutorial). Clef is an account management tool 
external to Geth itself that allows users to sign transactions. It is developed and maintained by 
the Geth team and is intended to eventually replace the account management tool built in to Geth.

## Prerequisites

In order to get the most value from the tutorials on this page, the following skills are necessary:

- Experience using the command line
- Basic knowledge about Ethereum and testnets
- Basic knowledge about HTTP and JavaScript

Users that need to revisit these fundamentals can find helpful resources relating to the command line 
[here][cli], 
Ethereum and its testnets [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/), http 
[here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) and Javascript [here](https://www.javascript.com/learn).

{% include note.html content="If Geth was installed from source on Linux, `make` saves the binaries for 
Geth and the associated tools in `/build/bin`. To run these programs it is convenient to move them to 
the top level project directory (e.g. running `mv ./build/bin/* ./`) from `/go-ethereum`. Then `./` must 
be prepended to the commands in the code snippets in order to execute a particular program, e.g. `./geth` 
instead of simply `geth`. If the executables are not moved then either navigate to the `bin` directory to 
run them (e.g. `cd ./build/bin` and `./geth`) or provide their path (e.g. `./build/bin/geth`). These 
instructions can be ignored for other installations." %}

## Background

Geth is an Ethereum client written in Go. This means running Geth turns a computer into an Ethereum node. 
Ethereum is a peer-to-peer network where information is shared directly between nodes rather than being 
managed by a central server. Nodes compete to generate new blocks of transactions to send to its peers 
because they are rewarded for doing so in Ethereum's native token, ether (ETH). On receiving a new block, 
each node checks that it is valid and adds it to their database. The sequence of discrete blocks is called 
a "blockchain". The information provided in each block is used by Geth to update its "state" - the ether 
balance of each account on Ethereum. There are two types of account: externally-owned accounts (EOAs) and 
contract accounts. Contract accounts execute contract code when they receive transactions. EOAs are accounts 
that users manage locally in order to sign and submit transactions. Each EOA is a public-private key pair, 
where the public key is used to derive a unique address for the user and the private key is used to protect 
the account and securely sign messages. Therefore, in order to use Ethereum, it is first necessary to generate 
an EOA (hereafter, "account"). This tutorial will guide the user through creating an account, funding it with 
ether and sending some to another address.

Read more about Ethereum accounts [here](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/).

## Step 1: Generating accounts

There are several methods for generating accounts in Geth. This tutorial demonstrates how to generate accounts 
using Clef, as this is considered best practice, largely because it decouples the users' key management from Geth, 
making it more modular and flexible. It can also be run from secure USB sticks or virtual machines, offering 
security benefits. For convenience, this tutorial will execute Clef on the same computer that will also run Geth, 
although more secure options are available (see [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/cmd/clef/docs/setup.md)).

An account is a pair of keys (public and private). Clef needs to know where to save these keys to so that they 
can be retrieved later. This information is passed to Clef as an argument. This is achieved using the following command:

```shell
clef newaccount --keystore geth-tutorial/keystore
```

The specific function from Clef that generates new accounts is `newaccount` and it accepts a 
parameter, `--keystore`, that tells it where to store the newly generated keys. In this 
example the keystore location is a new directory that will be created automatically: `geth-tutorial/keystore`. 
Clef will return the following result in the terminal:

```terminal
WARNING!

Clef is an account management tool. It may, like any software, contain bugs.

Please take care to
- backup your keystore files,
- verify that the keystore(s) can be opened with your password.

Clef is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY
without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.

Enter 'ok' to proceed:
>
```

This is important information. The `geth-tutorial/keystore` directory will soon contain a secret 
key that can be used to access any funds held in the new account. If it is compromised, the funds 
can be stolen. If it is lost, there is no way to retrieve the funds. This tutorial will only use 
dummy funds with no real world value, but when these steps are repeated on Ethereum mainnet is 
critical that the keystore is kept secure and backed up.


Typing `ok` into the terminal and pressing `enter` causes Clef to prompt for a password. 
Clef requires a password that is at least 10 characters long, and best practice would be 
to use a combination of numbers, characters and special characters. Entering a suitable 
password and pressing `enter` returns the following result to the terminal:

```terminal

```

It is important to save the account address and the password somewhere secure. 
They will be used again later in this tutorial. Please note that the account address shown 
in the code snippets above and later in this tutorials are examples - those generated by followers 
of this tutorial will be different. The account generated above can be used as the main account 
throughout the remainder of this tutorial. However in order to demonstrate transactions between 
accounts it is also necessary to have a second account. A second account can be added to the 
same keystore by precisely repeating the previous steps, providing the same password.

## Step 2:  Start Clef

The previous commands used Clef's `newaccount` function to add new key pairs to the keystore. 
Clef uses the private key(s) saved in the keystore is used to sign transactions. In order to do 
this, Clef needs to be started and left running while Geth is running simultaneously, so that the 
two programs can communicate between one another. 

To start Clef, run the Clef executable passing as arguments the keystore file location, 
config directory location and a chain ID. The config directory was automatically created 
inside the `geth-tutorial` directory during the previous step. The [chain ID](https://chainlist.org/) 
is an integer that defines which Ethereum network to connect to. Ethereum mainnet has chain ID 1. 
In this tutorial Chain ID 5 is used which is that of the Goerli testnet. It is very important that 
this chain ID parameter is set to 5. The following command starts Clef on Goerli:

```shell

clef --keystore geth-tutorial/keystore --configdir geth-tutorial/clef --chainid 5

```

After running the command above, Clef requests the user to type “ok” to proceed. On typing "ok" and pressing enter, Clef returns the following to the terminal:  

```terminal
INFO [02-10|13:55:30.812] Using CLI as UI-channel

```

This result indicates that Clef is running. This terminal should be left running for the duration of this 
tutorial. If the tutorial is stopped and restarted later Clef must also be restarted by running the previous command.

## Step 3:  Start Geth

Geth is the Ethereum client that will connect the computer to the Ethereum network. In this tutorial the 
network is Goerli, an Ethereum testnet. Testnets are used to test Ethereum client software and smart 
contracts in an environment where no real-world value is at risk. To start Geth, run the Geth executable 
file passing argument that define the data directory (where Geth should save blockchain data), 
signer (points Geth to Clef), the network ID and the sync mode. For this tutorial, snap sync is recommended 
(see [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) for reasons why). The final argument 
passed to Geth is the `--http` flag. This enables the http-rpc server that allows external programs to 
interact with Geth by sending it http requests. By default the http server is only exposed locally using 
port 8545: `localhost:8545`.

The following command should be run in a new terminal, separate to the one running Clef: 

```shell
geth --datadir geth-tutorial --signer=geth-tutorial/clef/clef.ipc --goerli --syncmode snap --http
```

Running the above command starts Geth. The terminal should rapidly fill with status updates, starting with:

```terminal

INFO [02-10|13:59:08.793] Block synchronisation started
```

This indicates that Geth has started up and is searching for peers to connect to. Once it finds peers it 
can request block headers from them, starting at the genesis block for the Goerli blockchain. Geth continues 
to download blocks sequentially, saving the data in files in `/go-ethereum/geth-tutorial/geth/chaindata/`. 
This is confirmed by the logs printed to the terminal. There should be a rapidly-growing sequence of logs in 
the terminal with the following syntax:

```terminal
INFO [04-29][15:54:09.238] Looking for peers             peercount=2 tried=0 static=0
INFO [04-29][15:54:19.393] Imported new block headers    count=2 elapsed=1.127ms  number=996288  hash=09f1e3..718c47 age=13h9m5s

```

These logs indicate that Geth is running as expected. Sending an empty Curl request to the http server 
provides a quick way to confirm that this too has been started without any issues. In a third terminal, 
the following command can be run:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8545
```

If there is no error message reported to the terminal, everything is OK. Geth must be running in order for 
a user to interact with the Ethereum network. If this terminal is closed down then Geth must be restarted 
in a new terminal. Geth can be started and stopped easily, but it must be running for any interaction with 
Ethereum to take place. To shut down Geth, simply press `CTRL+C` in the Geth terminal. To start it again, 
run the previous command `geth --datadir ... ..`.

{% include note.html content="Snap syncing Goerli will take some time and until the sync is finished you 
can't use the node to transfer funds. You can also try doing a [light sync](interface/les) which will be 
much quicker but depends on light servers being available to serve your node the data it needs." %}

## Step 4:  Get Testnet Ether

In order to make some transactions, the user must fund their account with ether. On Ethereum mainnet, 
ether can only be obtained in three ways: 1) by receiving it as a reward for mining/validating; 
2) receiving it in a transfer from another Ethereum user or contract; 3) receiving it from an exchange, 
3) having paid for it with fiat money. On Ethereum testnets, the ether has no real world value so it 
4) can be made freely available via faucets. Faucets allow users to request a transfer of testnet ether to their account.

The address generated by Clef in Step 1 can be pasted into the Paradigm Multifaucet faucet 
[here](https://fauceth.komputing.org/?chain=1115511). This requires a Twitter login as proof of 
personhood. The faucets adds ether to the given address on multiple testnets simultaneously, 
including Goerli. In the next steps Geth will be used to check that the ether has been sent 
to the given address and send some of it to the second address created earlier.


## Step 5: Interact with Geth

For interacting with the blockchain, Geth provides JSON-RPC APIs. 
[JSON-RPC](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) is a way to execute specific 
tasks by sending instructions to Geth in the form of [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) objects. 
RPC stands for "Remote Procedure Call" and it refers to the ability to send these JSON-encoded 
instructions from locations outside of those managed by Geth. It is possible to interact with Geth 
by sending these JSON encoded instructions directly over Geth's exposed http port using tools like Curl. 
However, this is somewhat user-unfriendly and error-prone, especially for more complex instructions. 
For this reason, there are a set of libraries built on top of JSON-RPC that provide a more user-friendly 
interface for interacting with Geth. One of the most widely used is Web3.js. 

Geth provides a Javascript console that exposes the Web3.js API. This means that with Geth running in one terminal, a Javascript environment can be opened in another allowing the user to interact with Geth using Web3.js. There are three transport protocols that can be used to connect the Javascript environment to Geth:

- IPC (Inter-Process Communication): Provides unrestricted access to all APIs, but only works when the console is run on the same host as the geth node.
  
- HTTP: By default provides access to the `eth`, `web3` and `net` method namespaces.

- Websocket: By default provides access to the `eth`, `web3` and `net` method namespaces.

This tutorial will use the HTTP option. Note that the terminals running Geth and Clef should both still be active. 
In a new (third) terminal, the following command can be run to start the console and connect it to Geth 
using the exposed http port:

```shell
geth attach http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

This command causes the terminal to hang because it is waiting for approval from Clef. Approving the request 
in the terminal running Clef will lead to the following welcome message being displayed in the Javascript console:

```terminal
Welcome to the Geth JavaScript console!

instance: Geth/v1.10.15-stable/darwin-amd64/go1.17.5
at block: 6354736 (Thu Feb 10 2022 14:01:46 GMT+0100 (WAT))
 modules: eth:1.0 net:1.0 rpc:1.0 web3:1.0

To exit, press ctrl-d or type exit
```

The console is now active and connected to Geth. It can now be used to interact with the Ethereum (Goerli) network.


### List of accounts

In this tutorial, the accounts are managed using Clef. This means that requesting information about 
the accounts requires explicit approval in Clef, which should still be running in its own terminal. 
Earlier in this tutorial, two accounts were created using Clef. The following command will display the 
addresses of those two accounts and any others that might have been added to the keystore before or since. 

```javascript
eth.accounts
```

The console will hang, because Clef is waiting for approval. The following message will be 
displayed in the Clef terminal:

```terminal
-------- List Account request--------------
A request has been made to list all accounts.
You can select which accounts the caller can see
  [x] 0xca57F3b40B42FCce3c37B8D18aDBca5260ca72EC
    URL: keystore:///.../geth-tutorial/keystore/UTC--2022-02-07T17-19-56.517538000Z--ca57f3b40b42fcce3c37b8d18adbca5260ca72ec
  [x] 0xCe8dBA5e4157c2B284d8853afEEea259344C1653
    URL: keystore:///.../geth-tutorial/keystore/UTC--2022-02-10T12-46-45.265592000Z--ce8dba5e4157c2b284d8853afeeea259344c1653
-------------------------------------------
Request context:
        NA - ipc - NA

Additional HTTP header data, provided by the external caller:
        User-Agent: ""
        Origin: ""
Approve? [y/N]:

```

Entering `y` approves the request from the console. In the terminal running the Javascript console, 
the account addresses are now displayed:

```terminal
["0xca57f3b40b42fcce3c37b8d18adbca5260ca72ec", "0xce8dba5e4157c2b284d8853afeeea259344c1653"]
```

It is also possible for this request to time out if the Clef approval took too long - 
in this case simply repeat the request and approval.


### Checking account balance.

Having confirmed that the two addresses created earlier are indeed in the keystore and accessible 
through the Javascript console, it is possible to retrieve information about how much ether they own. 
The Goerli faucet should have sent 1 ETH to the address provided, meaning that the balance of one of 
the accounts should be 1 ether and the other should be 0. The following command displays the account 
balance in the console:

```javascript
web3.fromWei(eth.getBalance("0xca57F3b40B42FCce3c37B8D18aDBca5260ca72EC"), "ether")
```

There are actually two instructions sent in the above command. The inner one is the `getBalance` 
function from the `eth` namespace. This takes the account address as its only argument. By default, 
this returns the account balance in units of Wei. There are 10<sup>18</sup> Wei to one ether. 
To present the result in units of ether, `getBalance` is wrapped in the `fromWei` function from 
the `web3` namespace. Running this command should provide the following result 
(for the account that received faucet funds):

```terminal
1
```

Repeating the command for the other account should yield:

```terminal
0
```

### Send ether to another account

The command `eth.sendTransaction` can be used to send some ether from one address to another. 
This command takes three arguments: `from`, `to` and `value`. These define the sender and 
recipient addresses (as strings) and the amount of Wei to transfer. It is far less error 
prone to enter the transaction value in units of ether rather than Wei, so the value field can 
take the return value from the `toWei` function. The following command, run in the Javascript 
console, sends 0.1 ether from one of the accounts in the Clef keystore to the other. Note that 
the addresses here are examples - the user must replace the address in the `from` field with 
the address currently owning 1 ether, and the address in the `to` field with the address 
currently holding 0 ether.

```javascript
eth.sendTransaction({
    from: "0xca57f3b40b42fcce3c37b8d18adbca5260ca72ec",
    to: "0xce8dba5e4157c2b284d8853afeeea259344c1653",
    value: web3.toWei(0.1, "ether")
})
```

Note that submitting this transaction requires approval in Clef. In the Clef terminal, 
Clef will prompt for approval and request the account password. If the password is correctly 
entered, Geth proceeds with the transaction. The transaction request summary is presented by 
Clef in the Clef terminal. This is an opportunity for the sender to review the details and 
ensure they are correct.

```terminal
--------- Transaction request-------------

Please enter the password for account 0xca57F3b40B42FCce3c37B8D18aDBca5260ca72EC

```

After approving the transaction, the following confirmation screen in displayed in 
the Clef terminal:

```terminal
-----------------------
Transaction signed:
 {
    "type": "0x2",
    "nonce": "0x3",
    "gasPrice": null,
    "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "0x908a901f",
    "maxFeePerGas": "0x908a9079",
    "gas": "0x5208",
    "value": "0x2386f26fc10000",
    "input": "0x",
    "v": "0x0",
    "r": "0x66e5d23ad156e04363e68b986d3a09e879f7fe6c84993cef800bc3b7ba8af072",
    "s": "0x647ff82be943ea4738600c831c4a19879f212eb77e32896c05055174045da1bc",
    "to": "0xce8dba5e4157c2b284d8853afeeea259344c1653",
    "chainId": "0x5",
    "accessList": [],
    "hash": "0x99d489d0bd984915fd370b307c2d39320860950666aac3f261921113ae4f95bb"
  }
```

In the Javascript console, the transaction hash is displayed. This will be used in the 
next section to retrieve the transaction details.

```terminal
"0x99d489d0bd984915fd370b307c2d39320860950666aac3f261921113ae4f95bb"
```

It is also advised to check the account balances using Geth by repeating the instructions from 
earlier. At this point in the tutorial, the two accounts in the Clef keystore should have balances 
just below 0.9 ether (because 0.1 ether has been transferred out and some small amount paid in 
transaction gas) and 0.1 ether.


### Checking the transaction hash

The transaction hash is a unique identifier for this specific transaction that can be used 
later to retrieve the transaction details. For example, the transaction details can be 
viewed by pasting this hash into the [Goerli block explorer](https://goerli.etherscan.io/). 
The same information can also be retrieved directly from the Geth node. The hash returned in 
the previous step can be provided as an argument to `eth.getTransaction` to return the 
transaction information:

```javascript
eth.getTransaction("0x99d489d0bd984915fd370b307c2d39320860950666aac3f261921113ae4f95bb")
```

This returns the following response (although the actual values for each field will vary 
because they are specific to each transaction):

```terminal
{
  accessList: [],
  blockHash: "0x1c5d3f8dd997b302935391b57dc3e4fffd1fa2088ef2836d51f844f993eb39c4",
  blockNumber: 6355150,
  chainId: "0x5",
  from: "0xca57f3b40b42fcce3c37b8d18adbca5260ca72ec",
  gas: 21000,

  value: 10000000000000000
}
```

## Using Curl

Up to this point this tutorial has interacted with Geth using the convenience library Web3.js. 
This library enables the user to send instructions to Geth using a more user-friendly interface 
compared to sending raw JSON objects. However, it is also possible for the user to send these 
JSON objects directly to Geth's exposed HTTP port. Curl is a command line tool that sends HTTP 
requests. This part of the tutorial demonstrates how to check account balances and send a 
transaction using Curl.

### Checking account balance

The command below returns the balance of the given account. This is a HTTP POST request to the 
local port 8545. The `-H` flag is for header information. It is used here to define the format 
of the incoming payload, which is JSON. The `--data` flag defines the content of the payload, 
which is a JSON object. That JSON object contains four fields: `jsonrpc` defines the spec version 
for the JSON-RPC API, `method` is the specific function being invoked, `params` are the function 
arguments, and `id` is used for ordering transactions. The two arguments passed to `eth_getBalance` 
are the account address whose balance to check and the block to query (here `latest` is used to 
check the balance in the most recently mined block).

```shell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_getBalance", "params":["0xca57f3b40b42fcce3c37b8d18adbca5260ca72ec","latest"], "id":1}'
```

A successful call will return a response like the one below:

```terminal
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xc7d54951f87f7c0"}
```

The balance is in the `result` field in the returned JSON object. However, it is denominated in 
Wei and presented as a hexadecimal string. There are many options for converting this value to a 
decimal in units of ether, for example by opening a Python console and running:

```python
0xc7d54951f87f7c0 / 1e18
```
This returns the balance in ether:

```terminal
0.8999684999998321
```

### Checking the account list

The curl command below returns the list of all accounts.

```shell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_accounts","params":[], "id":1}'
```

This requires approval in Clef. Once approved, the following information is returned to the terminal:

```terminal
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":["0xca57f3b40b42fcce3c37b8d18adbca5260ca72ec"]}
```

### Sending Transactions

Sending a transaction between accounts can also be achieved using Curl. Notice that the value of the 
transaction is a hexadecimal string in units of Wei. To transfer 0.1 ether, it is first necessary to 
convert this to Wei by multiplying by 10<sup>18</sup> then converting to hex. 0.1 ether is 
`"0x16345785d8a0000"` in hex. As before, update the `to` and `from` fields with the addresses in 
the Clef keystore.  


```shell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8545 \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "method":"eth_sendTransaction", "params":[{"from": "0xca57f3b40b42fcce3c37b8d18adbca5260ca72ec","to": "0xce8dba5e4157c2b284d8853afeeea259344c1653","value": "0x16345785d8a0000"}], "id":1}'
```

This requires approval in Clef. Once the password for the sender account has been provided, 
Clef will return a summary of the transaction details and the terminal that made the Curl 
request will display a response containing the transaction hash.

```terminal
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":5,"result":"0xac8b347d70a82805edb85fc136fc2c4e77d31677c2f9e4e7950e0342f0dc7e7c"}
```

## Summary

This tutorial has demonstrated how to generate accounts using Clef, fund them with testnet ether and use 
those accounts to interact with Ethereum (Goerli) through a Geth node. Checking account balances, sending 
transactions and retrieving transaction details were explained using the web3.js library via the 
Geth console and using the JSON-RPC directly using Curl. For more detailed information about Clef, please see
[the Clef docs](/docs/clef/tutorial).
