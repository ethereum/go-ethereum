title: Deploy Geth Lighthouse Ethereum Nodes via AWS Blockchain Node Runners
description: How to configure your Ethereum nodes with the geth lighthouse execution/consensus layer client combination using AWS Blockchain Node Runners.
---

[AWS Blockchain Node Runners (Node Runners)](https://aws-samples.github.io/aws-blockchain-node-runners/docs/intro) is an open-source initiative aimed at simplifying the deployment of self-managed blockchain nodes on AWS using vetted deployment blueprints and infrastructure configurations. Node Runners is designed to solve for the common challenges customers face in architecting and deploying blockchain nodes on AWS, such as identifying the optimal configurations for each specific blockchain protocolâ€™s node client.

## Architecture Overview

This blueprint has two configuration options for running Ethereum nodes and supports several Ethereum client combinations. You can set up a single JSON RPC node or multiple nodes in highly-available setup using the instructions below.

### Single RPC node setup
![Architecture-PoC](../docs/developers/geth-developer/doc/assets)

This setup is for small scale PoC or development environments. It deploys a single EC2 instance with both consensus and execution clients. The RPC port is exposed only to internal IP range of the VPC, while P2P ports allow external access to keep the clients synced.

### Highly available setup
![Architecture](../docs/developers/geth-developer/doc/assets/Architecture.png)

1.	An ongoing data synchronization process is configured with nodes in the Ethereum network with a sync node and RPC nodes.
2.	The sync node is used to create a copy of node's state data in Amazon S3 bucket.
3.	When new RPC nodes are provisioned, they copy state data from Amazon S3 bucket to speed up the initial sync process.
4.	Applications and smart contract development tools access highly available RPC nodes behind the Application Load Balancer.

## Solution Walkthrough

### Open AWS CloudShell

To begin, ensure you login to your AWS account with permissions to create and modify resources in IAM, EC2, EBS, VPC, S3, KMS, and Secrets Manager. 

From the AWS Management Console, open the [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html), a web-based shell environment. If unfamiliar, review the [2-minute YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fz4rbjRaiQM) for an overview and check out [CloudShell with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) that we'll use to test nodes API from internal IP address space.

Once ready, you can run the commands to deploy and test blueprints in the CloudShell.

### Clone this repository and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners.git
cd aws-blockchain-node-runners
npm install
```

> **NOTE:** *In this tutorial we will set all major configuration through environment variables, but you also can modify parameters in `config/config.ts`.*

### Prepare to deploy nodes

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository

2. If you have deleted or don't have the default VPC, create default VPC

```bash
aws ec2 create-default-vpc
```

> **NOTE:** *You may see the following error if the default VPC already exists: `An error occurred (DefaultVpcAlreadyExists) when calling the CreateDefaultVpc operation: A Default VPC already exists for this account in this region.`. That means you can just continue with the following steps.*

> **NOTE:** *The default VPC must have at least two public subnets in different Availability Zones, and public subnet must set `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` to `YES`*

3. Configure your Node Runners Ethereum blueprint deployment

To specify the Ethereum client combination you wish to deploy, create your own copy of `.env` file and edit it using your preferred text editor. The contents of your file for a Geth / Lighthouse node deployment is as follows, which uses a sample config from the repository:
```bash
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
cd lib/ethereum
pwd
cp ./sample-configs/.env-geth-lighthouse .env
nano .env
```
> **NOTE:** *You can find more examples inside the `sample-configs` directory, which illustrate other Ethereum client combinations.*


4. Deploy common components such as IAM role, and Amazon S3 bucket to store data snapshots

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
npx cdk deploy eth-common
```

### Option 1: Single RPC Node

1. Deploy Single RPC Node

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
npx cdk deploy eth-single-node --json --outputs-file single-node-deploy.json
```
> **NOTE:** *The default VPC must have at least two public subnets in different Availability Zones, and public subnet must set `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` to `YES`*

2. After starting the node you need to wait for the inital syncronization process to finish. It may take from half a day to about 6-10 days depending on the client combination and the state of the network. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to track the progress. There is a script that publishes CloudWatch metrics every 5 minutes, where you can watch `sync distance` for consensus client and `blocks behind` for execution client. When the node is fully synced those two metrics shold show 0. To see them:

   - Navigate to [CloudWatch service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) (make sure you are in the region you have specified for `AWS_REGION`)
   - Open `Dashboards` and select `eth-sync-node-<your-eth-client-combination>` from the list of dashboards.

4. Once the initial synchronization is done, you should be able to access the RPC API of that node from within the same VPC. The RPC port is not exposed to the Internet. Turn the following query against the private IP of the single RPC node you deployed:

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.node-instance-id? | select(. != null)')
NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PrivateIpAddress' --output text)
echo "NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$NODE_INTERNAL_IP"
```

Copy output from the last `echo` command with `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` and open [CloudShell tab with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html) to access internal IP address space. Paste `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` into the new CloudShell tab. Then query the API:

``` bash
# IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
# We query token balance of Beacon deposit contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa
curl http://$NODE_INTERNAL_IP:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
--data '{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa", "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

The result should be like this (the actual balance might change):

```javascript
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xe791d050f91d9949d344d"}
```

### Option 2: Highly Available RPC Nodes

1. Deploy Sync Node

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
npx cdk deploy eth-sync-node --json --outputs-file sync-node-deploy.json
```
**NOTE:** *The default VPC must have at least two public subnets in different Availability Zones, and public subnet must set `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` to `YES`*

2. After starting the node you need to wait for the inital syncronization process to finish. It may take from half a day to about 6-10 days depending on the client combination and the state of the network. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to track the progress. There is a script that publishes CloudWatch metrics every 5 minutes, where you can watch `sync distance` for consensus client and `blocks behind` for execution client. When the node is fully synced those two metrics shold show 0. To see them:

    - Navigate to [CloudWatch service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) (make sure you are in the region you have specified for `AWS_REGION`)
    - Open `Dashboards` and select `eth-sync-node-<your-eth-client-combination>` from the list of dashboards.

Once synchronization process is over, the script will automatically stop both clients and copy all the contents of the `/data` directory to your snapshot S3 bucket. That may take from 30 minutes to about 2 hours. During the process on the dashboard you will see lower CPU and RAM utilization but high data disc throughput and outbound network traffic. The script will automatically start the clients after the process is done.

> **Note:** *The snapshot backup process will automatically run every day at midnight of the time zone were the sync node runs. To change the schedule, modify `crontab` of the root user on the node's EC2 instance.*

3. Configure and deploy 2 RPC Nodes

```bash
pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
npx cdk deploy eth-rpc-nodes --json --outputs-file rpc-node-deploy.json
```

4. Give the new RPC nodes about 30 minutes (up to 2 hours for Erigon(???)) to initialize and then run the following query against the load balancer behind the RPC node created

```bash
export ETH_RPC_ABL_URL=$(cat rpc-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.alburl? | select(. != null)')
echo ETH_RPC_ABL_URL=$ETH_RPC_ABL_URL
```

```bash
# IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
# We query token balance of Beacon deposit contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa
curl http://$ETH_RPC_ABL_URL:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa", "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
```

The result should be like this (the actual balance might change):

```javascript
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xe791d050f91d9949d344d"}
```

   If the nodes are still starting and catching up with the chain, you will see the following repsonse:

```HTML
   <html>
   <head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>
   <body>
   <center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>
   </body>
```

> **NOTE:** By default and for security reasons the load balancer is available only from within the default VPC in the region where it is deployed. It is not available from the Internet and is not open for external connections. Before opening it up please make sure you protect your RPC APIs.

### Clearing up and undeploying everything

Destroy RPC Nodes, Sync Nodes and Comon components

```bash
# Setting the AWS account id and region in case local .env file is lost
 export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your_target_AWS_account_id>
 export AWS_REGION=<your_target_AWS_region>

pwd
# Make sure you are in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum

# Destroy Single RPC Node
cdk destroy eth-single-node

# Destroy RPC Nodes
cdk destroy eth-rpc-nodes

# Destroy Sync Node
cdk destroy eth-sync-node

# You need to manually delete an s3 bucket with a name similar to 'eth-snapshots-$accountid-eth-nodes-common' on the console,firstly empty the bucket,secondly delete the bucket,and then execute
# Delete all common components like IAM role and Security Group
cdk destroy eth-common
```
