description: Documentation for foundational Geth topics
---

This section includes documentation for foundational topics in Geth. The pages here will help you to understand how Geth works from a user perspective and under the hood.

This is where you will find information about how to manage a Geth node and understand how it functions.

For example, the pages here will help you to understand the underlying architecture of your Geth node, how to start it in different configurations using command line options, how to sync the blockchain and how to manage accounts. There is a page on security practices that will help you to keep your Geth node safe from adversaries.

Note also that there is a page explaining common log messages that are often queried on the Geth discord and GitHub - this will help users to interpret the messages displayed to the console and know what actions to take.
