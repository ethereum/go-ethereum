## Usage

> `npm install @scure/base`

> `deno add jsr:@scure/base`

> `deno doc jsr:@scure/base` # command-line documentation

We support all major platforms and runtimes. The library is hybrid ESM / Common.js package.

```js
import { base16, base32, base64, base58 } from '@scure/base';
// Flavors
import {
  base58xmr,
  base58xrp,
  base32nopad,
  base32hex,
  base32hexnopad,
  base32crockford,
  base64nopad,
  base64url,
  base64urlnopad,
} from '@scure/base';

const data = Uint8Array.from([1, 2, 3]);
base64.decode(base64.encode(data));

// Convert utf8 string to Uint8Array
const data2 = new TextEncoder().encode('hello');
base58.encode(data2);

// Everything has the same API except for bech32 and base58check
base32.encode(data);
base16.encode(data);
base32hex.encode(data);
```

base58check is a special case: you need to pass `sha256()` function:

```js
import { createBase58check } from '@scure/base';
createBase58check(sha256).encode(data);
```

## Bech32, Bech32m and Bitcoin

We provide low-level bech32 operations.
If you need high-level methods for BTC (addresses, and others), use
[scure-btc-signer](https://github.com/paulmillr/scure-btc-signer) instead.

Bitcoin addresses use both 5-bit words and bytes representations.
They can't be parsed using `bech32.decodeToBytes`.

Same applies to Lightning Invoice Protocol
[BOLT-11](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md).
We have many tests in `./test/bip173.test.js` that serve as minimal examples of
Bitcoin address and Lightning Invoice Protocol parsers.
Keep in mind that you'll need to verify the examples before using them in your code.

Do something like this:

```ts
const decoded = bech32.decode(address);
// NOTE: words in bitcoin addresses contain version as first element,
// with actual witness program words in rest
// BIP-141: The value of the first push is called the "version byte".
// The following byte vector pushed is called the "witness program".
const [version, ...dataW] = decoded.words;
const program = bech32.fromWords(dataW); // actual witness program
```

## Design rationale

The code may feel unnecessarily complicated; but actually it's much easier to reason about.
Any encoding library consists of two functions:

```
encode(A) -> B
decode(B) -> A
  where X = decode(encode(X))
  # encode(decode(X)) can be !== X!
  # because decoding can normalize input

e.g.
base58checksum = {
  encode(): {
    // checksum
    // radix conversion
    // alphabet
  },
  decode(): {
    // alphabet
    // radix conversion
    // checksum
  }
}
```

But instead of creating two big functions for each specific case,
we create them from tiny composable building blocks:

```
base58checksum = chain(checksum(), radix(), alphabet())
```

Which is the same as chain/pipe/sequence function in Functional Programming,
but significantly more useful since it enforces same order of execution of encode/decode.
Basically you only define encode (in declarative way) and get correct decode for free.
So, instead of reasoning about two big functions you need only reason about primitives and encode chain.
The design revealed obvious bug in older version of the lib,
where xmr version of base58 had errors in decode's block processing.

Besides base-encodings, we can reuse the same approach with any encode/decode function
(`bytes2number`, `bytes2u32`, etc).
For example, you can easily encode entropy to mnemonic (BIP-39):

```ts
export function getCoder(wordlist: string[]) {
  if (!Array.isArray(wordlist) || wordlist.length !== 2 ** 11 || typeof wordlist[0] !== 'string') {
    throw new Error('Wordlist: expected array of 2048 strings');
  }
  return mbc.chain(mbu.checksum(1, checksum), mbu.radix2(11, true), mbu.alphabet(wordlist));
}
```

### base58 is O(n^2) and radixes

`Uint8Array` is represented as big-endian number:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> 1*(256**4) + 2*(256**3) 3*(256**2) + 4*(256**1) + 5*(256**0)
where 256 = 2**8 (8 bits per byte)
```

which is then converted to a number in another radix/base (16/32/58/64, etc).

However, generic conversion between bases has [quadratic O(n^2) time complexity](https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/21799).

Which means base58 has quadratic time complexity too. Use base58 only when you have small
constant sized input, because variable length sized input from user can cause DoS.

On the other hand, if both bases are power of same number (like `2**8 <-> 2**64`),
there is linear algorithm. For now we have implementation for power-of-two bases only (radix2).

## Security

The library has been independently audited:

- at version 1.0.0, in Jan 2022, by [cure53](https://cure53.de)
  - PDFs: [online](https://cure53.de/pentest-report_hashing-libs.pdf), [offline](./audit/2022-01-05-cure53-audit-nbl2.pdf)
  - [Changes since audit](https://github.com/paulmillr/scure-base/compare/1.0.0..main).
  - The audit has been funded by [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/) with help of [Nomic Labs](https://nomiclabs.io)

The library was initially developed for [js-ethereum-cryptography](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography).
At commit [ae00e6d7](https://github.com/ethereum/js-ethereum-cryptography/commit/ae00e6d7d24fb3c76a1c7fe10039f6ecd120b77e),
it was extracted to a separate package called `micro-base`.
After the audit we've decided to use `@scure` NPM namespace for security.

### Supply chain security

- **Commits** are signed with PGP keys, to prevent forgery. Make sure to verify commit signatures
- **Releases** are transparent and built on GitHub CI. Make sure to verify [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) logs
- **Rare releasing** is followed to ensure less re-audit need for end-users
- **Dependencies** are minimized and locked-down: any dependency could get hacked and users will be downloading malware with every install.
  - We make sure to use as few dependencies as possible
  - Automatic dep updates are prevented by locking-down version ranges; diffs are checked with `npm-diff`
- **Dev Dependencies** are disabled for end-users; they are only used to develop / build the source code

For this package, there are 0 dependencies; and a few dev dependencies:

- micro-bmark, micro-should and jsbt are used for benchmarking / testing / build tooling and developed by the same author
- prettier, fast-check and typescript are used for code quality / test generation / ts compilation. It's hard to audit their source code thoroughly and fully because of their size

## Contributing & testing

- `npm install && npm run build && npm test` will build the code and run tests.
- `npm run lint` / `npm run format` will run linter / fix linter issues.
- `npm run build:release` will build single file
