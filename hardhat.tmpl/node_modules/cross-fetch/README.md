================

Universal WHATWG Fetch API for Node, Browsers, Workers and React Native. The scenario that cross-fetch really shines is when the same JavaScript codebase needs to run on different platforms.

- **Platform agnostic**: browsers, Node or React Native
- **Optional polyfill**: it's up to you if something is going to be added to the global object or not
- **Simple interface**: no instantiation, no configuration and no extra dependency
- **WHATWG compliant**: it works the same way wherever your code runs
- **TypeScript support**: better development experience with types.
- **Worker support**: works on different types of workers such as Service Workers and CloudFlare Workers

## Install

```sh
npm install --save cross-fetch
```

As a [ponyfill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill) (imports locally):

```javascript
// Using ES6 modules with Babel or TypeScript
import fetch from 'cross-fetch';

// Using CommonJS modules
const fetch = require('cross-fetch');
```

As a polyfill (installs globally):

```javascript
// Using ES6 modules
import 'cross-fetch/polyfill';

// Using CommonJS modules
require('cross-fetch/polyfill');
```


The CDN build is also available on unpkg:

```html
<script src="//unpkg.com/cross-fetch/dist/cross-fetch.js"></script>
```

This adds the fetch function to the window object. Note that this is not UMD compatible.

## Usage

With [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise):

```javascript
import fetch from 'cross-fetch';
// Or just: import 'cross-fetch/polyfill';

fetch('//api.github.com/users/lquixada')
  .then(res => {
    if (res.status >= 400) {
      throw new Error("Bad response from server");
    }
    return res.json();
  })
  .then(user => {
    console.log(user);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

With [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function):

```javascript
import fetch from 'cross-fetch';
// Or just: import 'cross-fetch/polyfill';

(async () => {
  try {
    const res = await fetch('//api.github.com/users/lquixada');
    
    if (res.status >= 400) {
      throw new Error("Bad response from server");
    }
    
    const user = await res.json();
  
    console.log(user);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
})();
```

## Demo & API

You can find a comprehensive doc at [Github's fetch](https://github.github.io/fetch/) page. If you want to play with cross-fetch, check our [**JSFiddle playground**](https://jsfiddle.net/lquixada/3ypqgacp/).

> **Tip**: Run the fiddle on various browsers and with different settings (for instance: cross-domain requests, wrong urls or text requests). Don't forget to open the console in the test suite page and play around.


## FAQ

#### Yet another fetch library?

I did a lot of research in order to find a fetch library that could be simple, cross-platform and provide polyfill as an option. There's a plethora of libs out there but none could match those requirements.

#### Why polyfill might not be a good idea?

In a word? Risk. If the spec changes in the future, it might be problematic to debug. Read more about it on [sindresorhus's ponyfill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill#how-are-ponyfills-better-than-polyfills) page. It's up to you if you're fine with it or not.

#### How does cross-fetch work?

Just like isomorphic-fetch, it is just a proxy. If you're in node, it delivers you the [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch/) library, if you're in a browser or React Native, it delivers you the github's [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch/). The same strategy applies whether you're using polyfill or ponyfill.
