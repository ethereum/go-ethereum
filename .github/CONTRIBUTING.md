## Can I have feature X

Before you do a feature request please check and make sure that it isn't possible
through some other means. The JavaScript enabled console is a powerful feature
in the right hands. Please check our [Bitchin' tricks](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/bitchin-tricks) wiki page for more info
and help.
