 * Sends the a transaction to run an OnchainInteraction.
 *
 * If this is the first transaction being sent for the OnchainInteraction, the

 *
 * This function estimates gas and runs a simulation before sending the transaction.
 *
 * Simulations are run both in the case of a failed gas estimation (to report
 * why it failed), and in the case of a successful gas estimation (to make sure
 * the transaction will not fail, and report any error).
 *
 * This function is meant to be used in conjuntion with the ExecutionStrategy's
 * generator that requested the OnchainInteraction, as is its responsibility to
 * decode the result of the simulation. The `decodeSimulationResult` callback is
 * more generic to make this function easier to test, but it should normally
 * call the generator's `next` and return its result, replacing
 * `SimulationSuccessSignal` results with `undefined`.
 *
 * Note that if we are resending a transaction for an OnchainInteraction, we
 * need a new ExecutionStrategy generator to decode the simulation result, as
 * the previous one will be waiting for a confirmed transaction.
 *
 * This function can be used in these cases:
 * - When the OnchainInteraction needs to start being executed (i.e. first tx).
 * - When we detected a dropped transaction and we need to resend it with the
 * same nonce.
 * - When we want to bump the fees of a transaction.
 *
 * This function MUST NOT be used in these cases:
 * - When we detected a dropped transaction and we need to resend it with a
 * different nonce.
 *
 * @param client The JsonRpcClient to use to interact with the network.
 * @param sender The account to send the transaction from.
 * @param onchainInteraction The OnchainInteraction to send the transaction for.
 * @param getNonce A callback to fetch the nonce for the transaction.
 * @param decodeSimulationResult A callback to decode the result of the simulation.
 *  This callback should return undefined if the simulation was successful, or
 *  a SimulationErrorExecutionResult or StrategyErrorExecutionResult if the
 *  simulation failed.
 * @returns Any error returned by decodeSimulationResult or an object with the
 *  transaction hash and nonce.
