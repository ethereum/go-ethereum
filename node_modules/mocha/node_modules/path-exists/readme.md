# path-exists [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/path-exists.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/path-exists)

> Check if a path exists

NOTE: `fs.existsSync` has been un-deprecated in Node.js since 6.8.0. If you only need to check synchronously, this module is not needed.

While [`fs.exists()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback) is being [deprecated](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/103), there's still a genuine use-case of being able to check if a path exists for other purposes than doing IO with it.

Never use this before handling a file though:

> In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions: another process may remove the file between the calls to `fs.exists()` and `fs.open()`. Just open the file and handle the error when it's not there.


## Install

```
$ npm install path-exists
```


## Usage

```js
// foo.js
const pathExists = require('path-exists');

(async () => {
	console.log(await pathExists('foo.js'));
	//=> true
})();
```


## API

### pathExists(path)

Returns a `Promise<boolean>` of whether the path exists.

### pathExists.sync(path)

Returns a `boolean` of whether the path exists.
