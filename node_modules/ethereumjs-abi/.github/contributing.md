# Contributing

Great that you want to contribute to the `EthereumJS` [ecosystem](https://ethereumjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html). `EthereumJS` is managed by the Ethereum Foundation and largely driven by the wider community. Everyone is welcome to join the effort and help to improve on the libraries (see our [Code of Conduct](https://ethereumjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code_of_conduct.html) ðŸŒ·).

We have written up some [Contribution Guidelines](https://ethereumjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#how-to-start) to help you getting started.

These include information on how we work with **Git** and how our **general workflow** and **technical setup** looks like (stuff like language, tooling, code quality and style).

Happy Coding! ðŸ‘¾ ðŸ˜€ ðŸ’»
