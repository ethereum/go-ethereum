/**
 * @file A meet-semilattice (or lower semilattice) is a semilattice whose operation is called `meet`, and which can be thought
 * of as a greatest lower bound.
 *
 * A `MeetSemilattice` must satisfy the following laws:
 *
 * - Associativity: `a ∧ (b ∧ c) = (a ∧ b) ∧ c`
 * - Commutativity: `a ∧ b = b ∧ a`
 * - Idempotency:   `a ∧ a = a`
