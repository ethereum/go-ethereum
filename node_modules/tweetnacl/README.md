Overview
--------

The primary goal of this project is to produce a translation of TweetNaCl to
JavaScript which is as close as possible to the original C implementation, plus
a thin layer of idiomatic high-level API on top of it.

There are two versions, you can use either of them:

* `nacl.js` is the port of TweetNaCl with minimum differences from the
  original + high-level API.

* `nacl-fast.js` is like `nacl.js`, but with some functions replaced with
  faster versions. (Used by default when importing NPM package.)


Audits
------

TweetNaCl.js has been audited by [Cure53](https://cure53.de/) in January-February
2017 (audit was sponsored by [Deletype](https://deletype.com)):

> The overall outcome of this audit signals a particularly positive assessment
> for TweetNaCl-js, as the testing team was unable to find any security
> problems in the library. It has to be noted that this is an exceptionally
> rare result of a source code audit for any project and must be seen as a true
> testament to a development proceeding with security at its core.
>
> To reiterate, the TweetNaCl-js project, the source code was found to be
> bug-free at this point.
>
> [...]
>
> In sum, the testing team is happy to recommend the TweetNaCl-js project as
> likely one of the safer and more secure cryptographic tools among its
> competition.

Installation
------------

You can install TweetNaCl.js via a package manager:

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

    $ yarn add tweetnacl

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/):

    $ npm install tweetnacl

or [download source code](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/releases).


Examples
--------
You can find usage examples in our [wiki](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js/wiki/Examples).


Usage
-----

All API functions accept and return bytes as `Uint8Array`s.  If you need to
encode or decode strings, use functions from
<https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-util-js> or one of the more robust codec
packages.

In Node.js v4 and later `Buffer` objects are backed by `Uint8Array`s, so you
can freely pass them to TweetNaCl.js functions as arguments. The returned
objects are still `Uint8Array`s, so if you need `Buffer`s, you'll have to
convert them manually; make sure to convert using copying: `Buffer.from(array)`
(or `new Buffer(array)` in Node.js v4 or earlier), instead of sharing:
`Buffer.from(array.buffer)` (or `new Buffer(array.buffer)` Node 4 or earlier),
because some functions return subarrays of their buffers.


### Public-key authenticated encryption (box)

Implements *x25519-xsalsa20-poly1305*.

#### nacl.box.keyPair()

Generates a new random key pair for box and returns it as an object with
`publicKey` and `secretKey` members:

    {
       publicKey: ...,  // Uint8Array with 32-byte public key
       secretKey: ...   // Uint8Array with 32-byte secret key
    }


#### nacl.box.keyPair.fromSecretKey(secretKey)

Returns a key pair for box with public key corresponding to the given secret
key.

#### nacl.box(message, nonce, theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Encrypts and authenticates message using peer's public key, our secret key, and
the given nonce, which must be unique for each distinct message for a key pair.

Returns an encrypted and authenticated message, which is
`nacl.box.overheadLength` longer than the original message.

#### nacl.box.open(box, nonce, theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Authenticates and decrypts the given box with peer's public key, our secret
key, and the given nonce.

Returns the original message, or `null` if authentication fails.

#### nacl.box.before(theirPublicKey, mySecretKey)

Returns a precomputed shared key which can be used in `nacl.box.after` and
`nacl.box.open.after`.

#### nacl.box.after(message, nonce, sharedKey)

Same as `nacl.box`, but uses a shared key precomputed with `nacl.box.before`.

#### nacl.box.open.after(box, nonce, sharedKey)

Same as `nacl.box.open`, but uses a shared key precomputed with `nacl.box.before`.

#### Constants

##### nacl.box.publicKeyLength = 32

Length of public key in bytes.

##### nacl.box.secretKeyLength = 32

Length of secret key in bytes.

##### nacl.box.sharedKeyLength = 32

Length of precomputed shared key in bytes.

##### nacl.box.nonceLength = 24

Length of nonce in bytes.

##### nacl.box.overheadLength = 16

Length of overhead added to box compared to original message.


### Secret-key authenticated encryption (secretbox)

Implements *xsalsa20-poly1305*.

#### nacl.secretbox(message, nonce, key)

Encrypts and authenticates message using the key and the nonce. The nonce must
be unique for each distinct message for this key.

Returns an encrypted and authenticated message, which is
`nacl.secretbox.overheadLength` longer than the original message.

#### nacl.secretbox.open(box, nonce, key)

Authenticates and decrypts the given secret box using the key and the nonce.

Returns the original message, or `null` if authentication fails.

#### Constants

##### nacl.secretbox.keyLength = 32

Length of key in bytes.

##### nacl.secretbox.nonceLength = 24

Length of nonce in bytes.

##### nacl.secretbox.overheadLength = 16

Length of overhead added to secret box compared to original message.


### Scalar multiplication

Implements *x25519*.

#### nacl.scalarMult(n, p)

Multiplies an integer `n` by a group element `p` and returns the resulting
group element.

#### nacl.scalarMult.base(n)

Multiplies an integer `n` by a standard group element and returns the resulting
group element.

#### Constants

##### nacl.scalarMult.scalarLength = 32

Length of scalar in bytes.

##### nacl.scalarMult.groupElementLength = 32

Length of group element in bytes.


### Signatures

Implements [ed25519](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to).

#### nacl.sign.keyPair()

Generates new random key pair for signing and returns it as an object with
`publicKey` and `secretKey` members:

    {
       publicKey: ...,  // Uint8Array with 32-byte public key
       secretKey: ...   // Uint8Array with 64-byte secret key
    }

#### nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSecretKey(secretKey)

Returns a signing key pair with public key corresponding to the given
64-byte secret key. The secret key must have been generated by
`nacl.sign.keyPair` or `nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSeed`.

#### nacl.sign.keyPair.fromSeed(seed)

Returns a new signing key pair generated deterministically from a 32-byte seed.
The seed must contain enough entropy to be secure. This method is not
recommended for general use: instead, use `nacl.sign.keyPair` to generate a new
key pair from a random seed.

#### nacl.sign(message, secretKey)

Signs the message using the secret key and returns a signed message.

#### nacl.sign.open(signedMessage, publicKey)

Verifies the signed message and returns the message without signature.

Returns `null` if verification failed.

#### nacl.sign.detached(message, secretKey)

Signs the message using the secret key and returns a signature.

#### nacl.sign.detached.verify(message, signature, publicKey)

Verifies the signature for the message and returns `true` if verification
succeeded or `false` if it failed.

#### Constants

##### nacl.sign.publicKeyLength = 32

Length of signing public key in bytes.

##### nacl.sign.secretKeyLength = 64

#### nacl.hash(message)

Returns SHA-512 hash of the message.

#### Constants

##### nacl.hash.hashLength = 64

Length of hash in bytes.


### Random bytes generation

#### nacl.randomBytes(length)

Returns a `Uint8Array` of the given length containing random bytes of
cryptographic quality.

**Implementation note**

TweetNaCl.js uses the following methods to generate random bytes,
depending on the platform it runs on:

* `window.crypto.getRandomValues` (WebCrypto standard)
* `window.msCrypto.getRandomValues` (Internet Explorer 11)
* `crypto.randomBytes` (Node.js)

If the platform doesn't provide a suitable PRNG, the following functions,
which require random numbers, will throw exception:

* `nacl.randomBytes`
* `nacl.box.keyPair`
* `nacl.sign.keyPair`

Other functions are deterministic and will continue working.

If a platform you are targeting doesn't implement secure random number
generator, but you somehow have a cryptographically-strong source of entropy
(not `Math.random`!), and you know what you are doing, you can plug it into
TweetNaCl.js like this:

    nacl.setPRNG(function(x, n) {
      // ... copy n random bytes into x ...
    });

Note that `nacl.setPRNG` *completely replaces* internal random byte generator
with the one provided.


### Constant-time comparison

#### nacl.verify(x, y)

Compares `x` and `y` in constant time and returns `true` if their lengths are
non-zero and equal, and their contents are equal.

Returns `false` if either of the arguments has zero length, or arguments have
different lengths, or their contents differ.


System requirements
-------------------

TweetNaCl.js supports modern browsers that have a cryptographically secure
pseudorandom number generator and typed arrays, including the latest versions
of:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari (Mac, iOS)
* Internet Explorer 11

Other systems:

* Node.js


Development and testing
------------------------

Install NPM modules needed for development:

    $ npm install

To build minified versions:

    $ npm run build

Tests use minified version, so make sure to rebuild it every time you change
`nacl.js` or `nacl-fast.js`.

### Testing

To run tests in Node.js:

    $ npm run test-node

By default all tests described here work on `nacl.min.js`. To test other
versions, set environment variable `NACL_SRC` to the file name you want to test.
For example, the following command will test fast minified version:

    $ NACL_SRC=nacl-fast.min.js npm run test-node

To run full suite of tests in Node.js, including comparing outputs of
JavaScript port to outputs of the original C version:

    $ npm run test-node-all

To prepare tests for browsers:

    $ npm run build-test-browser

and then open `test/browser/test.html` (or `test/browser/test-fast.html`) to
run them.

To run tests in both Node and Electron:

    $ npm test

### Benchmarking

To run benchmarks in Node.js:

    $ npm run bench
    $ NACL_SRC=nacl-fast.min.js npm run bench

To run benchmarks in a browser, open `test/benchmark/bench.html` (or
`test/benchmark/bench-fast.html`).

of the [home page](https://tweetnacl.js.org)).

In short, with *nacl-fast.js* and 1024-byte messages you can expect to encrypt and
authenticate more than 57000 messages per second on a typical laptop or more than
14000 messages per second on a $170 smartphone, sign about 200 and verify 100
messages per second on a laptop or 60 and 30 messages per second on a smartphone,
per CPU core (with Web Workers you can do these operations in parallel),
which is good enough for most applications.
