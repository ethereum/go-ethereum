## Code coverage for Solidity testing
![coverage example][22]

+ For more details about what this is, how it works and potential limitations,
  see [the accompanying article][16].
+ `solidity-coverage` is [Solcover][17]

## Requirements

+ Hardhat >= 2.11.0

## Install
```
$ yarn add solidity-coverage --dev
```

**Require** the plugin in `hardhat.config.js` ([Hardhat docs][26])
```javascript
require('solidity-coverage')
```

Or, if you are using TypeScript, add this to your hardhat.config.ts:
```ts
import 'solidity-coverage'
```

**Resources**:
+ [0.8.0 release notes][31]

## Run
```
npx hardhat coverage [command-options]
```

### Trouble shooting

**Missing or unexpected coverage?** Make sure you're using the latest plugin version and run:
```sh
$ npx hardhat clean
$ npx hardhat compile
$ npx hardhat coverage
```

**Typescript compilation errors?**
```sh
$ npx hardhat compile
$ TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=true npx hardhat coverage
```

**Weird test failures or plugin conflicts?**

```sh
# Setting the `SOLIDITY_COVERAGE` env variable tells the coverage plugin to configure the provider
# early in the hardhat task cycle, minimizing conflicts with other plugins or `extendEnvironment` hooks

$ SOLIDITY_COVERAGE=true npx hardhat coverage
```

## Command Options
| Option <img width=200/> | Example <img width=750/>| Description <img width=1000/> |
|--------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| testfiles  | `--testfiles "test/registry/*.ts"` | Test file(s) to run. (Globs must be enclosed by quotes and use [globby matching patterns][38])|
| sources | `--sources myFolder` or `--sources myFile.sol` | Path to *single* folder or file to target for coverage. Path is relative to Hardhat's `paths.sources` (usually `contracts/`) |
| solcoverjs | `--solcoverjs ./../.solcover.js` | Relative path from working directory to config. Useful for monorepo packages that share settings. (Path must be "./" prefixed) |
| matrix   | `--matrix` | Generate a JSON object that maps which mocha tests hit which lines of code. (Useful as an input for some fuzzing, mutation testing and fault-localization algorithms.) [More...][39]|

[<sup>*</sup> Advanced use][14]

## Config Options

Additional options can be specified in a `.solcover.js` config file located in the root directory
of your project.

**Example:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  skipFiles: ['Routers/EtherRouter.sol']
};
```

| Option <img width=200/>| Type <img width=200/> | Default <img width=1000/> | Description <img width=1000/> |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| skipFiles | *Array* | `[]` | Array of contracts or folders (with paths expressed relative to the `contracts` directory) that should be skipped when doing instrumentation.(ex: `[ "Routers", "Networks/Polygon.sol"]`) :warning: **RUN THE HARDHAT CLEAN COMMAND AFTER UPDATING THIS**  |
| modifierWhitelist | *String[]* | `[]` | List of modifier names (ex: `onlyOwner`) to exclude from branch measurement. (Useful for modifiers which prepare something instead of acting as a gate.)) |
| mocha | *Object* | `{ }` | [Mocha options][3] to merge into existing mocha config. `grep` and `invert` are useful for skipping certain tests under coverage using tags in the test descriptions. [More...][24]|
| measureStatementCoverage | *boolean* | `true` | Computes statement (in addition to line) coverage. [More...][34] |
| measureFunctionCoverage | *boolean* | `true` | Computes function coverage. [More...][34] |
| measureModifierCoverage | *boolean* | `true` | Computes each modifier invocation as a code branch. [More...][34] |
| **:printer:    OUTPUT** |  | |  |
| matrixOutputPath | *String* | `./testMatrix.json` | Relative path to write test matrix JSON object to. [More...][39]|
| mochaJsonOutputPath | *String* | `./mochaOutput.json` | Relative path to write mocha JSON reporter object to. [More...][39]|
| abiOutputPath | *String* | `./humanReadableAbis.json` | Relative path to write diff-able ABI data to |
| istanbulFolder | *String* | `./coverage` |  Folder location for Istanbul coverage reports. |
| istanbulReporter | *Array* | `['html', 'lcov', 'text', 'json']` | [Istanbul coverage reporters][2]  |
| silent | *Boolean* | false | Suppress logging output |
| **:recycle:    WORKFLOW HOOKS** |  | |  |
| onServerReady[<sup>*</sup>][14] | *Function* |   | Hook run *after* server is launched, *before* the tests execute. Useful if you need to use the Oraclize bridge or have setup scripts which rely on the server's availability. [More...][23] |
| onPreCompile[<sup>*</sup>][14] | *Function* |   | Hook run *after* instrumentation is performed, *before* the compiler is run. Can be used with the other hooks to be able to generate coverage reports on non-standard / customized directory structures, as well as contracts with absolute import paths. [More...][23] |
| onCompileComplete[<sup>*</sup>][14] | *Function* |  | Hook run *after* compilation completes, *before* tests are run. Useful if you have secondary compilation steps or need to modify built artifacts. [More...][23]|
| onTestsComplete[<sup>*</sup>][14] | *Function* |  | Hook run *after* the tests complete, *before* Istanbul reports are generated. [More...][23]|
| onIstanbulComplete[<sup>*</sup>][14] | *Function* |  | Hook run *after* the Istanbul reports are generated, *before* the coverage task completes. Useful if you need to clean resources up. [More...][23]|
| **:warning:    DEPRECATED** |  | |  |
| configureYulOptimizer | *Boolean* | false | **(Deprecated since 0.8.7)** Setting to `true` should resolve "stack too deep" compiler errors in large projects using ABIEncoderV2 |
| solcOptimizerDetails | *Object* | `undefined` |**(Deprecated since 0.8.7))** Must be used in combination with `configureYulOptimizer`. Allows you configure solc's [optimizer details][1001]. Useful if the default remedy for stack-too-deep errors doesn't work in your case (See [FAQ: Running out of stack][1002] ). |


[<sup>*</sup> Advanced use][14]

## Viewing the reports:
+ You can find the Istanbul reports written to the `./coverage/` folder generated in your root directory.

## API

Solidity-coverage's core methods and many utilities are available as an API.

```javascript
const CoverageAPI = require('solidity-coverage/api');
```

[Documentation available here][28].

## Detecting solidity-coverage from another task

If you're writing another plugin or task, it can be helpful to detect whether coverage is running or not.
The coverage plugin sets a boolean variable on the globally injected hardhat environment object for this purpose.

```
hre.__SOLIDITY_COVERAGE_RUNNING === true
```

## Example reports
+ [openzeppelin-solidity][10](Codecov)

## Funding

You can help fund solidity-coverage development through [DRIPS][1008]. It's a public goods protocol which helps distribute money to packages in your dependency tree. (It's great, check it out.)

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you're opening a PR that adds features or options *please consider
writing full [unit tests][11] for them*. (We've built simple fixtures for almost everything
and are happy to add some for your case if necessary).
