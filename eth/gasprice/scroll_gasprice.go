		//   2. Or, there is a pending transaction that could not be included because adding it would
		//      exceed the block's transaction payload size (block size limit).
		//
		// Since we don't have access to the txpool, we instead adopt the following heuristic:
		// consider a block as at capacity if either:
		//   - the total gas consumed by its transactions is within max-tx-gas-used of the block gas
		//     limit, where max-tx-gas-used is the most gas used by any one transaction within the block, or

		//     where max-tx-size-used is the largest transaction size in the block.
		//
		// This heuristic is almost perfectly accurate when transactions always consume the same amount
		// of gas and have similar sizes, but becomes less accurate as gas usage or payload size varies
		// between transactions. The typical error is that we assume a block is at capacity when it was
		// not, because max-tx-gas-used or max-tx-size-used will in most cases over-estimate the
		// "capacity margin". But it's better to err on the side of returning a higher-than-needed

// SuggestScrollPriorityFee returns a max priority fee value that can be used such that newly
// created transactions have a very high chance to be included in the following blocks, using a
// simplified and more predictable algorithm appropriate for chains like Scroll with a single
// known block builder.
//
// In the typical case, which results whenever the last block had room for more transactions, this
// function returns a minimum suggested priority fee value. Otherwise it returns the higher of this
// minimum suggestion or 10% over the median effective priority fee from the last block.
//
// Rationale: For a chain such as Scroll where there is a single block builder whose behavior is
// known, we know priority fee (as long as it is non-zero) has no impact on the probability for tx
// inclusion as long as there is capacity for it in the block. In this case then, there's no reason
// to return any value higher than some fixed minimum. Blocks typically reach capacity only under
// extreme events such as airdrops, meaning predicting whether the next block is going to be at
// capacity is difficult *except* in the case where we're already experiencing the increased demand
// from such an event. We therefore expect whether the last known block is at capacity to be one of
// the best predictors of whether the next block is likely to be at capacity. (An even better
// predictor is to look at the state of the transaction pool, but we want an algorithm that works
// even if the txpool is private or unavailable.)
//
// In the event the next block may be at capacity, the algorithm should allow for average fees to
// rise in order to reach a market price that appropriately reflects demand. We accomplish this by
// returning a suggestion that is a significant amount (10%) higher than the median effective
// priority fee from the previous block.
